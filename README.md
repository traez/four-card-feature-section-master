## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

1) Satisfactorily completed this in under 24 hours. Full speed ahead.  
2) Continued romance with CSS Grids, so far so good.  
3) Tried different selector combinations (attribute selectors) here.    
4) Had actual need for box shadow here.  

### Continued development

1) As usual additional middle media query would be nice. But will be a learning priority much later.  
2) As usual also could put more effort into item sizing to make clone exact copy.  

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, Google
